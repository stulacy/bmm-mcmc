  - Fix label switching issue:
    - Find way of saving probabilities / cluster labels from DP model so can use relabelling strategies (K = N is too high).
      Algorithm 3 of Stephens (2000b) is designed to be used online to reduce memory requirements
  - Alternative to DP model with unknown K:
    - Try implementing Stick-breaking construction
    - Try allocation sampler (Nobile and Fearnside 2007, collapses out bernoulli parameters and cluster weights when conjugate priors are used)
    - Try RJMCMC sampler (more general than allocation, samples all parameters. Richardson and Green 1997)
  - Incorporate redundant features into likelihood (look up White 2016)
  - Implement predictive distribution
