  - Fix label switching issue:
      - Implement label switching loss functions (Kullback-Leibler method) (see Stephens 2000)
      - Either use own implementation or the one availble in `label.switching` R package (in pure R so quite slow)
  - Alternative to DP model with unknown K:
      - Try allocation sampler (Nobile and Fearnside 2007, collapses out bernoulli parameters and cluster weights when conjugate priors are used)
      - Try RJMCMC sampler (more general than allocation, samples all parameters. Richardson and Green 1997)
  - Incorporate redundant features into likelihood (look up White 2016)
  - Implement predictive distribution
