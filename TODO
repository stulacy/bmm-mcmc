  - Alternative to DP model with unknown K:
    - Try allocation sampler (Nobile and Fearnside 2007, collapses out bernoulli parameters and cluster weights when conjugate priors are used)
    - Try RJMCMC sampler (more general than allocation, samples all parameters. Richardson and Green 1997)
    - Slice sampler ?
  - Incorporate redundant features into likelihood (look up White 2016)
  - Implement predictive distribution
  - Clean up src/ folder (put all lpsolve in one folder and get build working)
